The given sentence states that ||| Mr. Arvind faced an accusation of assaulting or beating the ||| students in the class. Hence, ‘accused of beating up on the’ is ||| the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 111 .(c) I would have had ||| The given sentence is an example of a third conditional ||| sentence and the correct grammatical structure for it is “If + past ||| perfect(had + V 3 ) …….. Would have + V 3 ”. Hence, ‘I would have ||| had’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 112 .(b) with their dialectical varieties ||| Possessive pronoun ‘Its’ is used for a singular noun and ‘their’ is ||| used for a plural noun. Similarly, ‘European languages’ is a plural ||| noun and it will take ‘their’ with it. Hence, ‘with their dialectical ||| varieties’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 113 .(a) finish the marathon in record time ||| The phrase ‘in record time’ means within a remarkably short ||| amount of time. Preposition ‘In’ specifies the time frame for the ||| action of finishing the marathon. Hence, ‘finish the marathon in ||| record time’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 114 .(a) more brave than intelligent ||| When there is a comparison between two qualities of a single ||| person or thing, we do not use normal comparative degree. E.g.- ||| more smart than beautiful(not ‘smarter than beautiful’). Similarly, ||| the given sentence compares two qualities, ‘bravery’ and ||| ‘intelligence’ of Himanshu. Hence, ‘more brave than intelligent’ is ||| the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 115 .(b) nothing else ||| ‘Nothing else’ is used to emphasize a quality or feature that one ||| has. Similarly, in the given sentence, there is emphasis on the ||| quality of pride. Hence, ‘nothing else’ is the most appropriate ||| answer. ||| Sol. 116 .(a) has not been and can never be ||| ‘Singular Sub. + has + V 3 ’ and ‘Modal(can) + V 1 ’ is the correct ||| grammatical structure for the given sentence. Hence, ‘has not ||| been(V 3 ) and can never be(V,)’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 117 .(c) has the prospect ||| According to the ‘Subject-Verb Agreement Rule’, a singular ||| subject always takes a singular verb. In the given sentence, ||| ‘integration’ is a singular subject that will take ‘has’ as a singular ||| verb. Hence, ‘has the prospect’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 118 .(d) Our teachers have planned a picnic ||| According to the “Subject-Verb ||| Agreement Rule”, a plural subject always takes a plural verb. ||| In the given sentence, ‘our teachers’ is a plural subject that will ||| take ‘have’ as a plural verb. Hence, ‘Our teachers have planned a ||| picnic’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 119 .(a) due to his hard work and dedication ||| ‘Their’ is used for plural nouns whereas ‘his’ is used for singular ||| nouns of common gender. In the given sentence, ‘the new ||| employees’ is a singular noun of common gender. Hence, ‘due to ||| his hard work and dedication’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 120 .(a) for the last several years ||| ‘Since’ is used to denote a point of time like since 1960. ‘For’ is ||| used for a fixed period of time(countable) like 2 years/3 ||| months/4 days/8 hours. Hence, ‘for the last several years’ is the ||| most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 121 .(a) from one and all in the country and abroad ||| The phrase ‘one and all’ conveys the idea that he received ||| appreciation from everyone. Also, article ‘the’ will be used before ||| the country. Hence, ‘from one and all in the country and abroad’ ||| is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 122 .(b) No correction required. ||| The given sentence is grammatically correct. ||| Sol. 123 .(c) continued to study for his upcoming exam ||| The given sentence contains a verb in past form i.e. “was ||| exhausted” so we will use simple past tense(V 2 ) in the latter ||| part. Hence, ‘continued to study for his upcoming exam’ is the ||| most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 124 .(b) did not call ||| ‘Yesterday’ denotes an action that happened in the past. So, we ||| need to use simple past tense(V 2 ) to make the sentence ||| grammatically correct. Hence, ‘did not call’ is the most ||||||Pinnacle ||| Sentence Improvement ||| appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 125 .(c) Prefigure - to give an advance indication or warning ||| of something. ||| Predict - to forecast or foretell an event or outcome. ||| Deliberate - to think carefully and consider all aspects before ||| making a decision. ||| Precipitate - to cause something to happen suddenly or ||| unexpectedly. ||| Proliferate - to cause something to happen suddenly or ||| unexpectedly. ||| Sol. 126 .(b) found everywhere in a huge amount ||| The phrase \"found everywhere in a huge amount\" conveys the ||| same meaning more clearly and grammatically. Hence, ‘found ||| everywhere in a huge amount’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 127 .(c) guests are gathered by ||| We use plural nouns after ‘all’ and the preposition ‘by’ means ||| near or close to something. Hence, ‘guests are gathered by’ is ||| the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 128 .(a) the newly released books ||| ‘Released’ means to make something available for public use & ||| ‘realised’ means to become aware of or understand something. ||| The phrase ‘the newly released books’ means the new books ||| which are now available for the public. Hence, ‘the newly ||| released books’ is the most appropriate answer. ||| Sol. 129 .(c) Reprehensible ||| ‘Reprehensible’ means deserving blame or strong criticism & ||| ‘Ignominious’ means deserving shame or disgrace. The given ||| sentence states that the fall of Ranjith for the petty material ||| benefit was really deserving of shame. Hence, ‘reprehensible’ is ||| the most appropriate answer. |||"
