One of the first widely used wetland classifications systems, devised by Cowardin et al., 1979, categorized wetlands into marine (coastal wetlands), estuarine (including deltas, tidal marshes, and mangrove swamps), lacustrine (lakes), riverine(alongriversandstreams), and palustrine (marshes, swamps and bogs) based on their hydrological, ecological and geological characteristics. Ramsar Convention on Wetlands was an international treaty signed in 1971.

Some of the animals are tracked down for their skins, horns, tusks, bones or hair, others are captured alive and sentoutof Africa as zoo animals, laboratory specimens or pets. There is such a wealth of animal life in Africa that many oftheanimal films that we see at the cinema are actually taken in the savanna. There are, in fact, two main groupsofanimalsinthe savanna, the grass-eating herbivorous animals and the fleshing-eating carnivorous animals. The herbivorous animals are often very alert and move swiftly from place to place in search of green pastures.

To make the mummy seem even morelife-like,sunkenareasofthebodywerefilledoutwithlinen and other materials and false eyes were added. Next the wrapping began. Each mummy needed hundreds of yards of linen. The priests carefully wound the long strips of linen around the body, sometimes even wrapping each finger and toe separately before wrapping the entire hand or foot.In ordertoprotectthedeadfrommishapinafterlife,amuletswere placed among the wrappings and prayers and magical words written on some of the linen strips.
